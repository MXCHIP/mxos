/** service descriptor
 *
 * Central to mdns is the notion of a service.  Hosts advertise service types
 * such as a website, a printer, some custom service, etc.  Network users can
 * use an mdns browser to discover services on the network.  Internally, this
 * mdns implementation uses the following struct to describe a service.  These
 * structs can be created by a user, populated, and passed to mdns announce
 * functions to specify services that are to be advertised. When a user starts a
 * query for services, the discovered services are passed back to the user in
 * this struct.
 *
 * The members include:
 *
 * servname: string that is the service instance name that will be advertised.
 * It could be something like "Brian's Website" or "Special Service on Device
 * #123".  This is the name that is typically presented to users browsing for
 * your service.  The servname must not exceed MDNS_MAX_LABEL_LEN bytes.  The
 * MDNS specification allows servname to be a UTF8 string.  However, only the
 * ascii subset of UTF-8 has been tested.
 *
 * servtype: string that represents the service type.  This should be a type
 * registered at http://dns-sd.org/ServiceTypes.html.  For example, "http" is
 * the service type for a web server and "ssh" is for an ssh server.  You may
 * use an unregisterd service type during development, but not in released
 * products.  Consider registering any new service types at the aforementioned
 * webpage.  servtype must be non-NULL.
 *
 * domain: string that represents the domain. If this value is NULL, domain
 * name ".local" will be used. The domain must not exceed
 * \ref MDNS_MAX_LABEL_LEN bytes.
 *
 * port: the tcp or udp port on which the service named servname is available
 * in network byte order.
 *
 * proto: Either MDNS_PROTO_TCP or MDNS_PROTO_UDP depending on what protocol
 * clients should use to connect to the service servtype.
 *
 * keyvals: NULL-terminated string of colon-separated key=value pairs.
 * Note: they can only be created by mdns_set_txt_rec() when initializing a service.
 *
 * keyvals are the key/value pairs for the TXT record associated with a service type.
 * For example, the servtype "http" defines the TXT keys "u", "p", and "path"
 * for the username, password, and path to a document.  If you supplied all of
 * these, the keyvals string would be:
 *
 * "u=myusername:p=mypassword:path=/index.html"
 *
 * If keyvals is NULL, no TXT record will be advertised.  If keyvals is ":", a
 * TXT record will appear, but it will not contain any key/value pairs.  The
 * key must be present (i.e., two contiguous ':' characters should never appear
 * in the keyvals string.)  A key may appear with no value.  The interpretation
 * of this depends on the nature of the service.  The length of a single
 * key/value pair cannot exceed MDNS_MAX_KEYVAL_LEN bytes.
 * It is the responsibility of the application to verify that the keyval string
 * is a valid string. The keyval string buffer is used by the mDNS module
 * internally and it can modify it. Hence, during subsequent calls to the mDNS
 * module, it is possible that the original string has been messed up and needs
 * to be recreated.
 *
 * ipaddr, fqsn, ptrname, kvlen and flags are for internal use only and should
 * not be dereferenced by the user.

 * Using mdns_announce_service() and mdns_announce_service_arr() call, services
 * are added to mDNS service list and are announced on a given interface.
 *
 * The querier thread just opens a socket and then waits until a request for
 * monitoring any given service type or subtype is received from the
 * application. When received, the same is queried and the responses are
 * processed, cached and monitored.
 * 
 * \param domain domain name string.  If this value is NULL, the domain ".local"
 * will be used. The domain must not exceed \ref MDNS_MAX_LABEL_LEN bytes.
 *
 * \param hostname string that is the hostname to resolve. This would be the
 * "foo" in "foo.local", for example.  The hostname must not exceed

 *
 * The domain and hostname must persist and remain unchanged between calls to
 * mdns_start and mdns_stop. Hence define these variables in global memory.
 *
 * While mdns_start returns immediately, the hostname and any servnames may
 * not be unique on the network.  In the event of a conflict, the names will
 * be appended with an integer.  For example, if the hostname "foo.local" is
 * taken, mdns will attempt to claim "foo-2.local", then foo-3.local, and so on
 * until the conflicts cease.  If mdns gets all the way to foo-9.local and
 * still fail, it waits for 5 seconds (per the mDNS specification) and then
 * starts back at foo.local.  If a developer anticipates a network to have many
 * of her devices, she should devise a sensible scheme outside of mdns to

/** mdns query callback
 *
 * A user initiates a query for services by calling the mdns_query_monitor
 * function with a fully-qualified service type, an mdns_query_cb, and an
 * opaque argument.  When a service instance is discovered, the query callback
 * will be invoked with following arguments:
 *
 * \param data a void * that was passed to mdns_query_monitor().  This can be
 * anything that the user wants, such as pointer to a custom internal data
 * structure.
 *
 * \param s A pointer to the struct mdns_service that was discovered.  The struct
 * mdns_service is only valid until the callback returns.  So if attributes of
 * the service (such as IP address and port) are required by the user for later
 * use, they must be copied and preserved elsewhere.
 *
 * \param status A code that reports the status of the query.  It takes one of the
 * following values:
 *
 * MDNS_DISCOVERED: The mdns_service s has just been discovered on the network
 * and will be monitored by the mdns stack.
 *
 * MDNS_UPDATED: The mdns_service s, which is being monitored, has been updated
 * in some way (e.g., it's IP address has changed, it's key/value pairs have
 * changed.)
 *
 * MDNS_DISAPPEARED: The mdns_service has left the network.  This usually
 * happens when a service has shut down, or when it has stopped responding
 * queries.  Applications may also detect this condition by some means outside
 * of mdns, such as a closed TCP connection.
 *
 * MDNS_CACHE_FULL: The mdns_service has been discovered.  However, the number
 * of monitored service instances has exceeded CONFIG_MDNS_SERVICE_CACHE_SIZE.
 * So the returned mdns_service may not be complete.  See NOTES below on other
 * implications of an MDNS_CACHE_FULL status.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * The query callback should return kNoErr in the case where it has
 * discovered service of interest (MDNS_DISCOVERED, MDNS_UPDATED status). If
 * the callback return non-zero value for MDNS_DISCOVERED and MDNS_UPDATED
 * status codes, that particular service instance is not cached by the mDNS
 * querier. This is required as each cached service instance takes little above
 * 1KB memory and the device can't monitor large number of service instances.
 *
 * Callback implementers must take care to not make any blocking calls, nor to
 * call any mdns API functions from within callbacks.
